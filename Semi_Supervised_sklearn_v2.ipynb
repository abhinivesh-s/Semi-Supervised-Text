Yeah, I know it\\'s not meant to compared to Ferris Bueller, at least not in a \"oranges-to-oranges\" way, but it will none-the-less.<br /><br />Bottom-line: It\\'s galaxies away from even being even a minor classic. It is watchable, though only if you\\'re not expecting very much. That said, the main character has some charm, but the premise wears thin because the writing just isn\\'t clever. The movie just did not deliver enough laughs, twists, or tension to keep my interest. <br /><br />To be honest I did continue watching...Watching with hopes to see if anything suddenly clicked. It didn\\'t. So, stylish as it is, I wouldn\\'t recommend this movie. BTW, it seems odd to see Mary Tyler Moore as the principal. She\\'s truly miscast, I hope the paycheck was inordinately big.'\n",

I think the kids doesn't seem to realize the gravity of the situation. Deker guy say to the girl that they under his responsibility when she ask why he wants to go back for them but right after this he gives a gun to the wheel chair dude and wants him to go alone repair the phone line. Where is the responsibility there? I understand poor actors must pay their food but why not just give them the money that takes to make a stupid movie like that or give that money to a charity. Oh yea and none of them knows how to aim. The stupid punk guy shoots in the cafeteria nowhere like a crazy. They all want to look professional but they all suck. One more thing I don't believe that there's no emergency exit in the school the kids are trying several doors but they all locked. What happens if there's a fire and the dumass security guard is dead? It is illegal to not have an emergency exit in school. Anyway there's a lot more to say but it would be too long. I spent some time of my life to watch a crap.\"\n",

I didn't think it was possible to make such a bad film in this day and age, i was wrong. While typing this message, I've thought of a good reason to buy this movie. A joke present at Xmas.
